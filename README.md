# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet engaging game designed for two players. This Java-based project aims to offer a pleasant gaming experience with a minimalist interface and intuitive gameplay mechanics. It's perfect for anyone looking for a quick, entertaining break or a way to practice strategic thinking.

## Game Rules
In Tic-Tac-Toe, two players compete on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to mark a cell with their respective symbol (X or O). The goal is to align three symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, to win the game. If all nine cells are filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a draw.
